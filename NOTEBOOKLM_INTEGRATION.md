# SAP ASSESSMENT - NOTEBOOKLM INTEGRATION NOTES

## Key Improvements from NotebookLM:

### 1. CONTEXT HOOK (Add First)
Before assessment, ask:
- "What are you assessing?" 
  - Personal growth (72-stage model)
  - Team/project (36-stage model)
  - Organization (9-stage macro)

### 2. STRUCTURED INTERVIEW PROTOCOL
After initial stage, ask:
- Life satisfaction (1-10)
- Changes in last 6 months
- "Are you building, crossing, or breaking down?"

### 3. STAGE-SPECIFIC VERIFICATION QUESTIONS
- **Stage 4:** "Does autopilot feel comfortable or concerning?"
- **Stage 5:** "Can you imagine returning to before this choice?"
- **Stage 8:** "When were you last fundamentally wrong?"

### 4. FRACTAL ADDRESS OUTPUT
Instead of just "Stage 5", show:
- **Fractal Address:** 5.3 (Stage 5, micro-stage 3)
- **Velocity:** Moving toward Stage 6
- **Anchor Prescription:** A2 (Threshold Care)

### 5. FULL STAGE DESCRIPTIONS (Use These)
**Stage 0: Plenara** - Ontological ground, undifferentiated potential
**Stage 3:** Signal Extraction - "Zinc Spark" moment
**Stage 5:** Bilateral choice - point of no return
**Stage 6:** Maintenance Controller - peak performance
**Stage 8:** Permanence Delusion - illusion of limitlessness

### 6. GURU-PROOF OUTPUT
- Show mathematical geometry
- Avoid mystical language
- Provide specific anchors (A1-A4)

## NEXT VERSION SHOULD INCLUDE:
1. Context selection screen
2. 6-month change questions
3. Fractal address (X.Y format)
4. Anchor prescriptions
5. Velocity indicators
