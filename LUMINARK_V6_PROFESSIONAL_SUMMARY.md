# ⚡ LUMINARK v6 PROFESSIONAL - UPGRADE SUMMARY

## 🎯 Objective
"Make it a lot more professional. No sliders."

## ✅ Changes Implemented
We have upgraded the Personal Assessment Platform to **v6 Professional**.

### 1. **Removed Sliders**
- replaced all range sliders with **Segmented Control Bars**.
- **Why?** Sliders can feel imprecise and "toy-like".
- **New Interaction**: Click anywhere on the 10-segment bar to set the level. It feels like a high-end audio instrument or sci-fi control panel.

### 2. **Professional UI Overhaul**
- **Color Palette**: Shifted to a deep slate/indigo theme (`#0f172a`) with precise cyan/indigo accents.
- **Typography**: Cleaner, more data-dense font sizing.
- **Layout**: Refined spacing grid (8px base) for a tighter, dashboard feel.
- **Icons**: Added `font-awesome` icons for better visual signaling.

### 3. **Enhanced Inputs**
- **Life Vector**: Grouped dropdowns into logical categories (Core, Meaning, Freedom, Belonging) for faster selection.
- **Intention Buttons**: Added icons and descriptions to the intention buttons for clarity.

### 4. **Deployment**
- The new design is live in `index.html`.
- Also saved as `luminark_v6_professional.html`.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. (Or deploy via your standard method, the file is ready).

## 🔮 Next Steps
- The Corporate Analyzer Streamlit UI is still on the roadmap if you wish to proceed with that next.
