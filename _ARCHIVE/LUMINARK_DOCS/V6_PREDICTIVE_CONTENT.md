### STAGE-SPECIFIC PREDICTIVE WARNINGS

*   **Stage 1: Navigation**
    *   *Warning:* "Your spark is clear, but your form is formless. If you do not ground this intuition in a stable anchor soon, the light will vanish back into the void."
    *   *Tarot:* The Magician (Manifesting will).

*   **Stage 2: Polarity**
    *   *Warning:* "You are defining yourself by what you are NOT. Beware the 'Othering' trap where you blame external dualities for your internal restlessness."
    *   *Tarot:* The High Priestess (Holding the tension).

*   **Stage 3: Expression**
    *   *Warning:* "The 'Zinc Flash' risk: You are outputting massive spirit, but your foundation is melting. Build a sustainable hearth or face rapid burnout."
    *   *Tarot:* The Empress (Abundant, chaotic creation).

*   **Stage 4: Foundation**
    *   *Warning:* "The Comfort Trap: Your bedrock is becoming a cage. If you do not introduce conscious tension soon, the universe will provide a crisis to force growth."
    *   *Tarot:* The Emperor (Established order).

*   **Stage 5: Threshold**
    *   *Warning:* "The Forbidden Fork: There is no returning to the Square. You must commit to the October tumble or remain in a state of perpetual shattering."
    *   *Tarot:* The Hierophant (Bridge between worlds).

*   **Stage 6: Integration**
    *   *Warning:* "The Harmony Illusion: You believe this peak is your home. Clinging to integration prevents the deep deconstruction required for Stage 7 wisdom."
    *   *Tarot:* The Lovers (Perfect alignment).

*   **Stage 7: Analysis**
    *   *Warning:* "The Brilliant Hermit: You have the patterns, but no community. Beware the isolation void where wisdom disconnects from the heartbeat of the whole."
    *   *Tarot:* The Hermit / The Tower (Light in the darkness).

*   **Stage 8: Unity (The Trap)**
    *   *Warning:* "CRITICAL: The Permanence Trap. You are mistaking your rigid container for your identity. If you do not release your 'I', the collapse will be catastrophic."
    *   *Tarot:* Strength Inverted (False Force).

*   **Stage 9: Release**
    *   *Warning:* "The Final Attachment: Do not try to OWN this enlightenment. If you claim the Source as yours, you snap back to Stage 8. Breathe and dissolve."
    *   *Tarot:* The World / Judgment (Completion of the cycle).
