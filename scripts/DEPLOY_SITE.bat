## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

### **Random Selection Algorithm:**
```python
import random

def get_stage_example(stage_number, previous_examples=[]):
    """
    Returns a random example for the given stage
    that hasn't been shown to this user recently
    """
    stage_pool = EXAMPLE_LIBRARY[stage_number]
    
    # Filter out recently shown examples
    available = [ex for ex in stage_pool if ex['id'] not in previous_examples]
    
    if not available:
        # Reset if all examples have been shown
        available = stage_pool
    
    selected = random.choice(available)
    
    return {
        'tradition': selected['tradition'],
        'example': selected['example'],
        'quote': selected.get('quote', ''),
        'explanation': selected['explanation']
    }
```

### **User History Tracking:**
```javascript
// Store in localStorage
let userHistory = {
    stage: 4,
    previous_examples: ['solomon_temple', 'sangha_established', 'temple_rituals'],
    assessment_dates: ['2024-01-15', '2024-02-10', '2024-03-05']
};
```

### **Adaptive Depth:**
- First time at stage: Brief example (2-3 sentences)
- Second time: Different example + comparative note
- Third time: Deep dive into pattern + "Why this keeps appearing"
- Fourth time: Integration practice + next stage preview

## TOTAL EXAMPLES PER STAGE:

- Stage 0: 10 examples
- Stage 1: 12 examples
- Stage 2: 15 examples
- Stage 3: 15 examples
