## 🔍 **Key Detection Algorithms**

### **Permanence Trap (Stage 8)**
Detects companies claiming permanent advantage:
- Adaptability dropping below 5.0
- Bureaucratic bloat (>8 management layers)
- Innovation theater (high R&D, low output)
- Leadership stagnation (CEO >12 years)
- Stock buybacks > R&D spending

**Historical accuracy:** Kodak, Nokia, GE, Boeing, Sears

### **Container Rule (Stage 4)**
Assesses if structure can hold complexity:
- **Ratio < 0.5:** Crisis imminent (12 months)
- **Ratio < 0.8:** Strain, strengthen foundation
- **Ratio > 1.2:** Ready to scale
- **Ratio 0.8-1.2:** Balanced, optimal

**Examples:**
- WeWork 2019: 0.3 (collapsed ✓)
- Zoom 2020: 1.4 (scaled successfully ✓)
