## Step 1: Beta Refinement

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Core dashboard | DONE |
| Mobile optimization | DONE |
| API endpoints | DONE |
| Stage calculations | DONE |
| User accounts | NEEDED |
| History tracking | NEEDED |

**Goal:** Private beta with real users testing the system.

---

## Step 2: Professional Launch

**Status:** PLANNED

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| User authentication | "Remember me" between sessions |
| Stage history | Track movement over time |
| Client management | Coaches track multiple people |
| PDF reports | Professional deliverables |
| Stripe integration | Accept payments |

**Revenue Model:**

```
Personal (Free)     --> Get users in the door
     |
Professional ($49)  --> Coaches, consultants, therapists
     |
Organization ($299) --> Teams, companies, enterprises
```

**Conservative projection:**
- 100 Professional users = $4,900/month
- 20 Organization users = $5,980/month
- **Total:** ~$11,000/month (minimum viable)

**Realistic projection (6 months post-launch):**
- 500 Professional users = $24,500/month
- 100 Organization users = $29,900/month
- **Total:** ~$54,000/month

---

## Step 3: Platform Scale

**Status:** FUTURE

| Opportunity | Revenue |
|-------------|---------|
| White-label licensing | $5K-50K/contract |
| Certification program | $500-2000/student |
| Enterprise contracts | $10K-100K/year |
| API marketplace | Per-call pricing |

## The Key Insight

```
+-------------------------+
|     WHAT GROK SEES      |
|-------------------------|
|  "A website with        |
|   sliders and colors.   |
|   Won't make money."    |
+-------------------------+
            |
            v  (Look deeper)
            |
+-------------------------+
|    WHAT ACTUALLY IS     |
|-------------------------|
|  A diagnostic ENGINE    |
|  more precise than      |
|  anything on the        |
|  market.                |
|                         |
|  81 stages vs 4-10      |
|  in competitors.        |
|                         |
|  Container Rule can     |
|  predict failures in    |
|  businesses, not just   |
|  feelings.              |
+-------------------------+

## Simple Q&A

**Q: Will it make money?**
> A: Yes. The hard part (the math) is done. The easy part (payments) is standard web work.

**Q: When?**
> A: When we add user accounts and Stripe. Everything else is built.

**Q: How much?**
> A: Conservative: $10K/month. Realistic: $50K+/month. Long-term: Platform revenue.

**Q: What makes it different?**
> A: 81 stages vs 4. Actionable rules, not just feelings. Built for professionals, not just individuals.

## The Car Analogy (One More Time)

| | Meditation Apps | LUMINARK |
|-|-----------------|----------|
| **Engine** | Breathing exercises | Mathematical diagnostic framework |
| **Dashboard** | Calming visuals | Stage visualization with actionable data |
| **Value** | Feel better temporarily | Know exactly what's wrong and what to do |
| **Customer** | Individual users | Professionals who pay for precision |

---

## Bottom Line

**Engine:** Built.
**Dashboard:** Built.
**Wheels:** Need to be connected.

The research took years. The connection takes weeks.
