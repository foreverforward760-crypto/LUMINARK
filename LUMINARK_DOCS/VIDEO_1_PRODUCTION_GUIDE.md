## 📝 FILMING SCRIPT (10 minutes):

### **SHOT 1: HOOK (0:00-0:30)**
**Nikki on camera, energetic**

"In 1929, 2008, and 2021, the same pattern appeared before every major crash. And almost nobody saw it coming. Today, I'm going to show you the mathematical framework that detected all three—and it's so simple, you'll wonder why nobody talks about it."

**[Show graphics: 1929 chart, 2008 chart, 2021 crypto chart]**

**FILMING TIP:** Do this 3 times, pick best take!

---

### **SHOT 2: INTRO (0:30-1:30)**
**Nikki introduces SAP**

"I'm Nikki, and today we're diving into SAP—Stanfield's Axiom of Perpetuity. It's a framework that maps how ANY system evolves through 9 predictable stages. And here's the kicker: Stage 8 is where things look perfect... right before they collapse."

**[Show circle graphic with stages 0-9]**

---

### **SHOT 3: STAGES 0-4 (1:30-4:00)**
**Quick montage with voiceover**

- Stage 0: Plenara - "The void, pure potential"
- Stage 1: Spark - "The idea ignites"
- Stage 2: Polarity - "Clear choices emerge"
- Stage 3: Motion - "Taking action, building momentum"
- Stage 4: Foundation - "Structure and stability"

**FILMING TIP:** Can film these separately and edit together!

---

### **SHOT 4: STAGE 8 - THE TRAP (4:30-6:30)**
**Most important section - Nikki serious**

"But here's where it gets dangerous. Stage 8. This is the permanence trap."

**[Show examples with graphics]**
- 1929: "Market will go up forever" → Crash
- 2008: "Housing never goes down" → Crash
- 2021: "Bitcoin to $100K guaranteed" → Crash

"See the pattern? High certainty + low adaptability = Stage 8. And Stage 8 ALWAYS tumbles to Stage 9."

**FILMING TIP:** Lean in, speak slower, emphasize danger!

---

### **SHOT 5: CALL TO ACTION (8:30-10:00)**
**Nikki smiling, upbeat**

"Want to know YOUR current stage? I've created a free assessment tool. Link in the description. Takes 2 minutes, gives you personalized results."
