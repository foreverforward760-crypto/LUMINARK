# 🌌 LUMINARK Ω-CLASS
### Quantum-Sapient AI Framework

LUMINARK is an advanced AI framework designed with "Beast Mode" architecture, featuring toroidal attention mechanisms, quantum confidence verification, and a mycelial safety defense system.

## 🚀 How to Run (The Easy Way)

1.  Find the file **`run_luminark.bat`** in this folder.
2.  **Double-click it**.
3.  A web browser will open automatically with your LUMINARK Dashboard.

## 🧠 What is this?

This is a **Production-Grade AI Framework** containing:
*   **Modular Architecture**: Organized in `luminark/` package (Layers, Training, Safety).
*   **The Beast Model**: A 6-layer deep neural network designed for complex pattern recognition.
*   **Checkpointing**: Save/Load your models automatically.
*   **Docker Ready**: Deploy anywhere with `docker-compose`.
*   **Quantum Verification**: A safety system that estimates "confidence" using quantum mechanics concepts.

## 🛠️ For Developers

To run manually from a terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run luminark_dashboard.py
```

## ⚠️ Production Note
Currently, this system runs on **Mock Data** (random numbers) to demonstrate its capabilities. To make it solve *real* problems, you would need to feed it a real dataset (like text documents, financial data, or scientific readings).
