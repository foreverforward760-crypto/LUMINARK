## 🎥 YouTube Video Templates

### **Video 1: "5-Minute Demo of Quantum AI Safety"**

**Length:** 5 minutes
**Hook:** "Watch AI that knows when to be careful"

**Script:**
```
[0:00-0:30] Hook + Introduction
"Most AI is overconfident. Watch what happens when we add quantum
uncertainty and 5 layers of safety protocols."

[0:30-2:00] Training Demo
"Let's train a model. Notice how it tracks 10 awareness stages in
real-time - from Receptive to Transcendence."
[Click Start Training, narrate as it trains]

[2:00-3:30] Predictions with Safety
"Now let's make predictions. Watch how the AI changes its tone
based on confidence..."
[Make high-confidence prediction → Empathy mode]
[Make low-confidence prediction → Paranoia mode with warnings]

[3:30-4:30] QA Testing
"Before deploying, we pressure-test it with adversarial noise,
edge cases, and consistency checks."
[Click Run QA, show results]

[4:30-5:00] Wrap-up
"5 layers of safety. Zero configuration. That's LUMINARK."
```

**Editing Notes:**
- Zoom in on SAR stage transitions
- Highlight empathy/paranoia mode differences
- Show QA results clearly
- End with "Link in description"

### **Video 2: "Why Rich People Feel Empty (The AI Explanation)"**

**Length:** 8-10 minutes
**Hook:** "AI just proved ancient wisdom about suffering and comfort"

**Script:**
```
[0:00-1:00] Hook
"There's a pattern in AI training that mirrors human psychology.
Even stages are physically stable but spiritually seeking.
Odd stages are the opposite. Let me show you."

[1:00-3:00] The Inversion Principle
[Whiteboard or slides explaining your SAP framework]
"When AI is performing well (even stages), it seeks optimization -
like how wealthy people seek meaning. When it's struggling
(odd stages), it has clarity about what it needs."

[3:00-5:00] Live Demonstration
[Launch dashboard, show training]
"Watch these stage transitions. Stage 0,2,4,6,8 - stable but restless.
Stage 1,3,5,7,9 - unstable but focused."

[5:00-7:00] The Paranoia/Empathy Switch
"This is why the AI switches modes. In crisis (stage 7-8), it becomes
paranoid - cautious. In integration (4-6), empathetic - helpful."
[Demo predictions at different stages]

[7:00-8:00] Human Application
"This isn't just AI. This is the pattern of growth. Comfort breeds
seeking. Struggle breeds clarity."

[8:00-10:00] NSDT Connection
[If you have it] "And we can measure this in real-time with the
Nested Spiral Diagnostic Tool..."
```

**Editing Notes:**
- Graphics for SAP stages
- Side-by-side: AI stages vs human psychology
- Overlay text for key quotes
- Background music (royalty-free)

### **Video 3: "I Built an AI That Tests Itself (DeepAgent + Quantum)"**

**Length:** 6-8 minutes
**Hook:** "What if AI could find its own vulnerabilities?"

**Script:**
```
[0:00-0:45] Problem Setup
"Most AI deployment: Train → Hope it works → Ship it.
Better way: Train → Test ruthlessly → Know it works → Ship it."

[0:45-2:00] DeepAgent Integration
"DeepAgent introduced automated QA. I integrated it with quantum
confidence. Now the AI knows not just IF it's wrong, but HOW wrong."

[2:00-4:00] Live QA Demo
[Run QA suite, explain each test]
- "Pressure test: Inject noise, see if it breaks"
- "Boundary test: Edge cases that kill normal models"
- "Consistency test: Does it give same answer twice?"
- "Regression test: Is it getting worse over time?"

[4:00-6:00] The Results
"Look at this: 8.3% degradation under heavy noise. That's robust.
But we also caught one vulnerability - see this warning?"
[Point to specific issue]

[6:00-8:00] Why This Matters
"Production AI needs this. Medical diagnosis? Test it.
Financial predictions? Test it. Self-driving? DEFINITELY test it."
```

**Editing Notes:**
- Screen recording of QA tests running
- Highlight vulnerability warnings
- Show "before/after" QA results
- Real-world failure examples (stock footage)

3. **Hide browser bookmarks bar**
4. **Use Incognito/Private mode** (no extensions)

### Cursor:
1. **Slow, deliberate movements**
2. **Circle important items**
3. **Pause on key metrics**

### Pacing:
1. **Don't rush** - let viewers read
2. **Wait 2-3 seconds** after clicking before speaking
3. **Repeat important numbers** (e.g., "98% accuracy, that's 98%")

## 🚀 Live Demo Tips

**If presenting live (not recording):**

1. **Pre-train the model** before demo starts
2. **Have backup browser tab** ready
3. **Test internet connection** if cloud-hosted
4. **Prepare 3-4 predictions** with interesting descriptions
5. **Know your reset procedure** (Stop → Refresh → Start)

**Common Issues:**
- Training stuck? → Stop and restart
- Prediction error? → Check model is trained (status = "Ready")
- QA error? → Ensure training completed all 50 epochs
- Nothing updating? → Check browser console (F12)
